This dataset (tidy_data.txt) contains the summarized mean values of each variable from the activity tracking dataset.
It is formatted in a wide format, with the id variables (subjectID, activityID, and activityLabel) representing a unique observation of a subject performing an activity, and the rest of the columns representing observed variables on that observation.

The following variables are included in the file:

subjectID - ID number of the subject (integer)
activityID - ID number of the activity being performed (integer)
activityLabel - Descriptive label of the activity being performed (character)
tBodyAcc_mean___X - mean value of the variable for the subject-activity pair in this record (numeric)
